   <h3>Q1.What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</h3> 
   <pre>
    The for...in statements combo iterates (loops) over the properties of an object.

    The code block inside the loop is executed once for each property.

    Example:
    let text = "";
    for (let x in location) {
           text += x + "
     ";
   }
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;

   </pre>

  <h3>Q2.Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</h3>
  <pre>
    Function scope: Variables that are declared inside a function are called local variables and in the function scope. Local variables are accessible anywhere inside the function. Block scope: Variable that is declared inside a specific block & can't be accessed outside of that block
    Scope Chain means that one variable has a scope (it may be global or local/function or block scope) is used by another variable or function having another scope (may be global or local/function or block scope). This complete chain formation goes on and stops when the user wishes to stop it according to the requirement.
  </pre>

   <h3>Q3.What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h3>
   <pre>
    Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript. Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.
   
    Null:

    null ? console.log("true") : console.log("false") // false
    Null is also referred as false.

    Undefined:

    When variable is not assigned a value

    var temp;
    if(temp === undefined)
    console.log("true");
    else
    console.log("false");

</pre>

<h3>Q4.what is Symbol?</h3>

<pre>
    Symbol is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol primitive — also called a Symbol value or just a Symbol — that's guaranteed to be unique
</pre>

<h3>Q5.Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</h3>

<pre>
    Map
   The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array.

   Syntax
   var new_array = arr.map(function callback(element, index, array) {
    // Return value for new_array
  }[, thisArg])


  Filter
  The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. If the condition returns false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.

  Syntax
  var new_array = arr.filter(function callback(element, index, array) {
    // Return true or false
  }[, thisArg])
  The syntax for filter is similar to map, except the callback function should return true to keep the element, or false otherwise. In the callback, only the element is required.
</pre>

<h3>Q6.Explain passed by value and passed by reference</h3>
<pre>
    Pass by Value: The method parameter values are copied to another variable and then the copied object is passed, that's why it's called pass by value. Pass by Reference: An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method, that's why it's called pass by reference.
</pre>

<h3>Q7.Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</h3>

<pre>
    Self-Invoking Functions
    Function expressions can be made "self-invoking".
    
    A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called.
    
    Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by ().
    
    You cannot self-invoke a function declaration.
    
    You have to add parentheses around the function to indicate that it is a function expression:
    
    Example
    (function () {
      let x = "Hello!!";  // I will invoke myself
    })();
</pre>
